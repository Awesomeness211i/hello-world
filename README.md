Learning to use github properly

Hello I am Christopher Iman and I am 17 at the time of writing this, some things I like doing are coding, and learning. I know that there is a lot I don't know but want to close that gap a little bit by learning as much as I can in a short period of time but I also take the time to try to take the time to understand the things I learn like if I want to implement graphics on a computer I want to start from as close to the ground up as possible to get a good understanding as to what is happening. I have a bit of experience with Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C, and Java but mostly am working with C++ now because it intrigued me since it was such a low level language and that some things I could do without much help from other libraries. Graphics programming really is something I am interested in at the low level because I want to understand how these machines interpret the commands necessary for the job and how to transform that into visual data but there isn't much information that I can find on the topic which makes me wonder even more about it.

Much of what I do is basically reconstructing the wheel because I want to understand why and how it all works, and not much information is out there that is specific enough and or general enough to cover everything I want to learn in exactly the way I want to understand it. There are many tutorials out there that make use of libraries and other APIs that I think is valuable knowledge but doesn't fit what I need it to which is building something from nothing at all except for your main function and your "return 0;" statement to making an application that a user has a nice time interacting with. That is all for now.
